# Data-Visualization-Machine-Learning-Decision-Tree-Classification-Tool-for-Income-Prediction-Tool
I analyze and explore US Census Bureau Data using Data Visualizations techniques to find Salient Features useful for predicting an individual's income level.  We use those relevant features to train a Decision-Tree Classifier that can predict income given data on salient features.  Our client is a local University who wants to use income as the key demographic to decide criteria for marketing its degree programs.
