# Data-Visualization-Machine-Learning-Decision-Tree-Classification-Tool-for-Income-Prediction-Tool
I use Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn libraries) to analyze and explore US Census Bureau Data using Data Visualizations techniques to find Salient Features useful for predicting an individual's income level.  We use those relevant features to train a Decision-Tree Classifier that can predict income given data on salient features.  Our client is a local University who wants to use income as the key demographic to decide criteria for marketing its degree programs. The classifier has an accuarcy of over 85%.
